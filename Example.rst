This file will give you a short tutorial showing you the basics of the reStructuredText (.rst) language.


First Things First
------------------

Paragraphs and Titles are the first things you'll encounter.  To make a paragraph all you have to do is type the text out like you would normally but without indentation.  In order to separate paragraphs put one or more lines in between the two paragraphs like the example below (in order to separate sections put two or more lines in between):

```
This is paragraph one.  This is just some text to show you how to write a paragraph.  Aren't paragraphs fun?

This is paragraph two.  Just some more filler text to make every thing look like two paragraphs.  Yea, they kind of are!
```


There are two types of titles with the difference being one is larger than the other.  The biggest title or 'headline title' as we will call it, is made by putting a series of equal signs under it:

```
Headline Title
==============
```

And the smaller title or the 'section title' is made by putting a series of dashes underneath like so:

```
Section Title
-------------
```
