# :computer: reStructured Docs

### Description
A guide to write and push reStructuredText documentation to GitHub using only the Atom text editor. Here you will be using the Git-Plus Atom package, cloning a documentation repo, and adding/committing/pushing some changes to GitHub.

#### 1. Check for Git-Plus Atom package
Open Atom and go to `Atom > Preferences`.  Once here you will see a tab menu on the left.  Look for the tab labeled 'Packages' and click on it.  Here you will see a list of all packages installed on your Atom editor.  You can either scroll and look for the one labeled 'git-plus' or you can search for it with the search bar at the top.  If you see it listed congratulations, you can move to the next step!  If not you can go to my guide on how to [set up your environment](https://github.com/JediKev/reStructured-docs-setup) for this and then go to the next step.

#### 2. Clone documentation repo
